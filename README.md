# Welcome to my Github page!



## About me
My name is Yuxin Zhang. You can also call me Chloe! I'd like to thank you for taking time to visit my Github page. I recently graduated from UC Davis with double degree in Economics and Applied Statistics. During my fourth year, I became very curious about data science after taking few data science classes. Data Science is such a powerful tool to discover useful insights and translate data findings into actionable strategies. I'm excited to learn all aspects of data science and to become a data scientist one day in the future. 

## My Projects

### Stats 141B : Data & Web Technologies for Data Analysis

In this course, I've done data extraction through web scraping, api calls, and thorough exploratory data analysis involving visualization and statistical and machine learning techniques. In one project, to explore more: [link](github-page/hw5.ipynb), I analyzed a collection of data sets from the San Francisco Open Data Portal and Zillow. By asking few questions that I am interested in, I explored the dataset and found some interesting findings about SF crime rates and housing price. I used SQL to extract and read information. To better illustrate the findings, I applied maps from Geopandas by matching Zipcodes and matplotlib to compare the results. Under each question, I wrote the analysis of the findings
