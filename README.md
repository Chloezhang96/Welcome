# Welcome to my Github page!



## About me
My name is Yuxin Zhang. You can also call me Chloe! I'd like to thank you for taking time to visit my Github page. I recently graduated from UC Davis with double degree in Economics and Applied Statistics. During my fourth year, I became very curious about data science after taking few data science classes. Data Science is such a powerful tool to discover useful insights and translate data findings into actionable strategies. I'm excited to learn all aspects of data science and to become a data scientist one day in the future.
