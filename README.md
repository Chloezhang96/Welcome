# Welcome to my Github page!



## About me
My name is Yuxin Zhang. You can also call me Chloe! I'd like to thank you for taking time to visit my Github page. I am a first year graduate student in Statistical Science at University of California Santa Cruz. During this summer, I had chance to work at iFlytek, a key supplier of intelligent speech technologies, as a deep learning research intern. From this internship, I learned some fundemental concepts of deep learning especially in the field of optical character recognition. I was also engaged in several projects such as using synthetic text dataset in natual scene to optimize recognition accuracy, robust reading on signboard and etc. This learning journey for the past few months has been nothing but truthfully challenging and fulfilling, and reaffirmed my passion in data science. Data Science is such a powerful tool to discover useful insights and translate data findings into actionable strategies. I'm excited to learn all aspects of data science especially the aspects of deep learning and to become a data scientist one day in the future. 

## My Projects

### Stats 141B : Data & Web Technologies for Data Analysis

In this course, I've done data extraction through web scraping, api calls, and thorough exploratory data analysis involving visualization and statistical and machine learning techniques. 

To explore more:

[Exploration of SF data](https://github.com/Chloezhang96/github-page/blob/master/hw5.ipynb)
I analyzed a collection of data sets from the San Francisco Open Data Portal and Zillow. By asking few questions that I am interested in, I explored the dataset and found some interesting findings about SF crime rates and housing price. I used SQL to extract and read information. To better illustrate the findings, I applied maps from Geopandas by matching Zipcodes and matplotlib to compare the results. 

[Exploration of Aggie News](https://github.com/Chloezhang96/github-page/blob/master/hw6.ipynb)
In this project, I scraped text from the website [The California Aggie](https://theaggie.org/) and then analyzed the text. The goal of this project is to practice data extraction, visualization and natural language processing. 

    
### Stats 141A: Fundamentals of Statistical Data Science 

This course introduces computing for data analysis and visualization, and simulation, using a high-level language such as R. I learned computational reasoning, statistical modeling, reading tabular and non-standard data. 

[Handwritten Digit Recognition](https://github.com/Chloezhang96/Welcome/blob/master/Final%20Project%20--%20STA141A.pdf)
In the past, postal workers sorted mail by hand, which was tedious and expensive. Then to improve efficiency and save costs, USPS has switched to automated mail sorting, using statistical classifiers to identify the individual digits in the zip code on each piece of mail. In this project, I implemented the k-nearest neighbors algorithm for classifying handwritten digits in zip codes.
